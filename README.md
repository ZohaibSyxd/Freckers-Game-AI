# Freckers Game AI â€“ Minimax Algorithm

This project implements a basic AI agent for the **Freckers Game** using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI is capable of evaluating game states and choosing optimal moves based on recursive game tree exploration.

## ðŸŽ® About the Game

Freckers is a two-player, turn-based strategy game. Each player takes turns making moves on a game board, aiming to outsmart the opponent and reach a winning condition.

> **Note**: The exact rules and mechanics of Freckers should be explained or linked here.

## ðŸ§  AI Logic â€“ Minimax Algorithm

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games. It recursively evaluates all possible moves to determine the best one, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

### Features:
- Recursive Minimax implementation
- Customizable depth limit
- Evaluation function for non-terminal game states
- Optional alpha-beta pruning
